adding to a heap:
1. compare new value to root
  a) if min-heap:
    - if new value is > root, continue to step 2
    - if new value is < root, new value becomes the new root
  b) if max-heap:
    - if new value is > root, new value becomes the new root
    - if new value is < root, continue to step 2
2. compare new value to left or right subtree
  repeat step 1, with this node substituted for "root"

remove from a heap:
1. compare children of root
  a) if min-heap:
    - child with min key becomes new root
    - return old root
  b) if max-heap:
    -child with max key becomes new root
    - return old root
