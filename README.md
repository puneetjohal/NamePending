# NamePending
### Xinyi Huang, Puneet Johal, Andrew Shao

### Decisions
We decided to use Andrew's homework because the runtimes of his methods were in allignment with the API on the Duke website. Additionally, his code is clean and easy to read, and the comments preceding each method clearly state the runtime. His main method is also very easy to understand, tests all the methods, and has comments for expected outcomes.

### Runtimes:
*add: O(1)
*removeMin: O(n)
*peekMin: O(n)
*isEmpty: O(1)
